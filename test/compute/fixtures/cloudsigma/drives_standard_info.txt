description Puppy Linux is extraordinarily small, yet quite full featured. Puppy boots into a 64MB ramdisk, and that&#39;s it, the whole caboodle runs in RAM. Unlike live CD distributions that have to keep pulling stuff off the CD, Puppy in its entirety loads into RAM. This means that all applications start in the blink of an eye and respond to user input instantly. Puppy Linux has the ability to boot off a flash card or any USB memory device, CDROM, Zip disk or LS/120/240 Superdisk, floppy disks, internal hard drive. It can even use a multisession formatted CD-R/DVD-R to save everything back to the CD/DVD with no hard drive required at all!

description Legacy OS (formerly TEENpup Linux) is a distribution based on Puppy Linux. Although the original concept was to create a flavour of Puppy Linux with more applications and a more appealing desktop aimed at teenage users, Legacy OS has now grown to become a general purpose distribution. It comes with a large number of applications, browser plugins and media codecs as standard software. Despite these enhancements Legacy OS is still perfectly suitable for installation on older and low-resource computers, as well as modern hardware.

description ReactOS® is a free, modern operating system based on the design of Windows® XP/2003. Written completely from scratch, it aims to follow the Windows-NT® architecture designed by Microsoft from the hardware level right through to the application level. This is not a Linux based system, and shares none of the unix architecture.  The main goal of the ReactOS project is to provide an operating system which is binary compatible with Windows. This will allow your Windows applications and drivers to run as they would on your Windows system. Additionally, the look and feel of the Windows operating system is used, such that people accustomed to the familiar user interface of Windows® would find using ReactOS straightforward. The ultimate goal of ReactOS is to allow you to remove Windows® and install ReactOS without the end user noticing the change.

description Vector Linux is a small, fast, Intel based Linux operating system for PC style computers. The creators of Vector Linux had a single credo: keep it simple, keep it small and let the end user decide what their operating system is going to be. What has evolved from this concept is perhaps the best little Linux operating system available anywhere. For the casual computer user you have a lightening fast desktop with graphical programs to handle your daily activities from web surfing, sending and receiving email, chatting on ICQ or IRC to running an ftp server. The power user will be pleased because all the tools are there to compile their own programs, use the system as a server or perhaps the gateway for their home or office computer network. Administrators will be equally as pleased because the small size and memory requirements of the operating system can be deployed on older machines maybe long forgotten.

The Fedora Project is an openly-developed project designed by Red Hat, open for general participation, led by a meritocracy, following a set of project objectives. The goal of The Fedora Project is to work with the Linux community to build a complete, general purpose operating system exclusively from open source software. Development will be done in a public forum. The project will produce time-based releases of Fedora about 2-3 times a year, with a public release schedule. The Red Hat engineering team will continue to participate in building Fedora and will invite and encourage more outside participation than in past releases. By using this more open process, we hope to provide an operating system more in line with the ideals of free software and more appealing to the open source community.

install_notes ***You must update the default root/superuser password for Fedora 13 on first login.***\n\nPre-installed Fedora 13 64bit Linux on 24/07/2010\n============================================================\n\n1. Minimum Hardware Requirements\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe recommended minimum hardware requirements based on user feedback are:\n\nCPU: 1GHz\nRAM: 1GHz\n\nWe recommend specifying a larger size for a better user experience.\n\n\n2. Access your server for the first time using VNC\n----------------------------------------------------\nInitially you will need to access your server via VNC to complete the setup. \n\na) Start up your new server.\n\nb) Please use one of the recommended VNC clients, you will find a full list by following the &#39;Connect to your server via VNC now&#39; link on general tab of the server detail window.\n\nb) Use the IP address and VNC password as provided on the general tab of the server detail window.\n\nc) After a few seconds you should see your server appear.\n\n\n3. Complete the personalisation of your new server\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nUpon first start-up you should be presented with the welcome screen after the initial boot process has completed. You will now have the opportunity to personalise your system installation. \na) Click the &#39;forward&#39; button to get started.\n\nb) You will now see the license information for this system. Fedora 13 has an open source GNU license. Assuming this is acceptable you should click the &#39;forward&#39; button again.\n\nc) You can now create your own user account, enter your name and set the password. Please note:\n\nTHIS IS NOT THE ADMINISTRATIVE ACCOUNT. YOU SHOULD RESET THE ROOT/SUPERUSER PASSWORD AS OUTLINED IN STEP 4 BELOW AFTER COMPLETING STEP 3.\n\nd) After clicking forward again you will have the opportunity to set the time servers that will set your servers time. You can just leave the default values unless you have some specific needs. Once you are happy please click the &#39;forward&#39; button.\n\ne) Finally you have the option to submit your hardware profile to the Fedora Project to help with their development. This is entirely your personal choice. Either way once you are ready click the &#39;finish&#39; button.\n\n4. Update your root/superuser password\n----------------------------------------------------\n\nThe default account is: cloudsigma\nThe default root/superuser password is set to: cloudsigma .\n\nPlease CHANGE this IMMEDIATELY after first connecting with VNC.\n\na) Open a terminal or use the command line.\n\nb) Type the command:\n\nsu root\n\nWhen prompted use the password &#39;cloudsigma&#39; (don&#39;t type the quote marks). The prompt should change to show you now using the root/superuser account.\n\nc) Now type the command:\n\npasswd\n\nd) When prompted enter a new password. We recommend a password of at least 8 characters including upper case and lower case letters as well as numbers.\n\ne) CoudSigma does not have access to your server account passwords. It is imperative that you securely store and manage your own passwords for your servers.\n\nf) Please note your root/superuser password is different from your VNC password. You can change your VNC password from the web console at any time.\n\n\n5. Expanding your drive\n--------------------------------\n\nThe system is fully installed and designed to expand to fill the initial size of the drive. After first login you should find that the system has used the full disk size as its partition.\n\n\n6. Enabling Remote Access\n--------------------------------------\n\nVNC access is always enabled in our cloud allowing emergency recovery. We recommend using SSH to access your server for command line actions. By default this is turned off initially for security reasons. You will need to enable and install SSH if you wish to use it for access moving forward.\n\n\n7. Networking\n-------------------------\na) IP networking can be left as DHCP. Even if you are using a static IP address with this server our management layer will apply the same IP address via DHCP. Using DHCP ensures you will have no issues receiving the correct networking settings. We recommend using DHCP initially if only to receive all the correct networking settings.\n\nb) CloudSigma employs an open networking infrastructure. All ports are open for inbound and outbound traffic with the exception of port 25 (SMTP) which is blocked for trial users.\n\nIt is important that you secure access to your server according to your needs.

Enabling Remote Access\n--------------------------------------\n\nVNC access is always enabled in our cloud allowing emergency recovery. We recommend using SSH to access your server for command line actions. By default this is turned off initially for security reasons. You will need to enable and install SSH if you wish to use it for access moving forward.\n\n\n5. Networking\n-------------------\na) IP networking can be left as DHCP. Even if you are using a static IP address with this server our management layer will apply the same IP address via DHCP. Using DHCP ensures you will have no issues receiving the correct networking settings. We recommend using DHCP initially if only to receive all the correct networking settings.\n\nb) CloudSigma employs an open networking infrastructure. All ports are open for inbound and outbound traffic with the exception of port 25 (SMTP) which is blocked for trial users.\n\nIt is important that you secure access to your server according to your needs.

description VECTORLINUX is a small, fast, Intel Linux operating system based on one of the original Linux distributions, Slackware. The enormously popular Slackware is the true &quot;Unix&quot; of Linux distributions and is used by major corporations, universities and home users alike. It&#39;s popularity stems from the fact that it is a robust, versatile and almost unbreakable system. Slackware has been traditionally known to be about as user friendly as a coiled rattlesnake and that&#39;s where Vector Linux comes into play. We have produced a bloat free, easy to install, configure and maintain Slackware based system that is second to none.

description The community-oriented Unity Linux is a minimalist distribution and live CD based on Mandriva Linux. The project&#39;s main goal is to create a base operating system from which more complete, user-oriented distribution can easily be built - either by other distribution projects or by the users themselves. Unity Linux uses Openbox as the default window manager. Its package management is handled via Smart and RPM 5 which can download and install additional software packages from the project&#39;s online repository.
