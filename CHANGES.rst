Changelog
=========

Changes with Apache Libcloud in development
-------------------------------------------

General
~~~~~~~

- Use native ``ssl.match_hostname`` functionality when running on Python >=
  3.2 and only require ``backports.ssl_match_hostname`` dependency on Python
  versions < 3.2.
  [Tomaz Muraus]

Compute
~~~~~~~

- Add support for creating volumes based on snapshots to EC2 and OS drivers.
  Also modify signature of base NodeDriver.create_volume to reflect the fact
  that all drivers expect a StorageSnapshot object as the snapshot argument.
  (GITHUB-467, LIBCLOUD-672)

- VolumeSnapshots now have a `created` attribute that is a `datetime`
  field showing the creation datetime of the snapshot. The field in
  VolumeSnapshot.extra containing the original string is maintained, so
  this is a backwards-compatible change.
  (GITHUB-473)
  [Allard Hoeve]

- Improve GCE create_node, make sure ex_get_disktype function
  (GITHUB-448)
  [Markos Gogoulos]

  base API.
  (LIBCLOUD-664, GITHUB-451)
  [Allard Hoeve]

  [Vanč Levstik]

Changes with Apache Libcloud 0.17.0

  raises the not-found exception instead. This fixes a bug where returning
  None caused ex_delete_image to raise an AttributeError.
  (GITHUB-441)
  [Eric Johnson]

  ``upload_object_via_stream`` method.

  This way user can specify CORS headers with the drivers which support that.
  (GITHUB-403, GITHUB-404)
  [Peter Schmidt]

- Fix upload_object_via_stream so it works correctly under Python 3.x if user
  manually passes an iterator to the method.

  Also improve how reading a file in chunks works with drivers which support
  chunked encoding - always try to fill a chunk with CHUNK_SIZE bytes instead
  of directly streaming the chunk which iterator returns.

  Previously, if iterator returned 1 byte in one iteration, we would directly
  send this as a single chunk to the API.

General
~~~~~~~

- Deprecate LazyList method of iteration over large paginated collections
  and use a new, more efficient generator based approach which doesn't
  require the iterator to be pre-exhausted and buffering all of the values

General
~~~~~~~

- Make parsing of the Auth API responses in the OpenStack drivers more
  flexible and extensible.

  Now, every connection class that inherits from the openstack base
  connection must implement get_endpoint(), who's job is to return the
  correct endpoint out of the service catalog.

  Rackspace nova. The default endpoint parsed from the service catalog
  is the default compute endpoint for devstack. (LIBCLOUD-151)

  driver class. This scopes all the endpoints returned by the Auth API
  endpoint to the provided tenant. (LIBCLOUD-172)
