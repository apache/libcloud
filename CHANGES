Changes with Apache Libcloud 0.12.1:

  *) General

    - Deprecate LazyList method of iteration over large paginated collections
      and use a new, more efficient generator based approach which doesn't
      require the iterator to be pre-exhausted and buffering all of the values
      in memory.

      Existing list_* methods which previously used LazyList class are
      preserving the old behavior and new iterate_* methods which use a new
      generator based approach have been added. (LIBCLOUD-254)
      [Mahendra M]

      requests using Libcloud http layer.

      Also refactor existing drivers which use xmlrpclib directly (VCL, Gandi,
      Softlayer) to use this module.

      This change allows drivers to support LIBCLOUD_DEBUG and SSL certificate
      validation functionality. Previously they have bypassed Libcloud http
      layer so this functionality was not available. (LIBCLOUD-288)
      [John Carr]

  *) Compute

      - changes in xmlrpc module
      (LIBCLOUD-245)
      [Tomaz Muraus]

    - Refactor Rackspace driver classes and make them easier to use. Now there
      are two rackspace constants - Provider.RACKSPACE which represents new
      next-gen OpenStack servers and Provider.RACKSPACE_FIRST_GEN which
      represents old cloud servers.

      Note: This change is backward incompatible. For more information on those
      changes and how to upgrade your code to make it work with it, please visit
      TODO.

   - Add new EC2 instance type - High Storage Eight Extra Large Instance
     (hs1.8xlarge).
     [Tomaz Muraus]

      Note: Deprecated constants will continue to work for the foreseeable
      future.
      [Tomaz Muraus]

    - Support for multipart uploads and other improvements in the S3 driver
      so it can more easily be re-used with other implementations (e.g. Google
      Storage, etc.).

      Also default to a multipart upload when using upload_object_via_stream.
      This methods is more efficient compared to old approach because it only
      requires buffering a single multipart chunk (5 MB) in memory.
      (LIBCLOUD-269)

Changes with Apache Libcloud 0.9.1:

  *) General:

    - Make parsing of the Auth API responses in the OpenStack drivers more
      flexible and extensible.

      Now, every connection class that inherits from the openstack base

      correct endpoint out of the service catalog.

      Note: The openstack.py base driver no longer works by default with
      Rackspace nova. The default endpoint parsed from the service catalog
      is the default compute endpoint for devstack. (LIBCLOUD-151)
      [Brad Morgan]
