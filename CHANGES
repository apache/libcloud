      flexible and extensible.

      Now, every connection class that inherits from the openstack base
      connection must implement get_endpoint(), who's job is to return the
      correct endpoint out of the service catalog.

      Note: The openstack.py base driver no longer works by default with
      Rackspace nova. The default endpoint parsed from the service catalog
      is the default compute endpoint for devstack. ; LIBCLOUD-151
      [Brad Morgan]

      Node extra dictionary. ; LIBCLOUD-163
      [Chris Gilmer]

    - Alow users to use a list of tuples for the query string parameters inside
      the OpenStack connection classes. This way same key can be specified

    - Allow user to pass 'max_tries' keyword argument to deploy_node method.
      [Tomaz Muraus]
