    disparate package hierarchies.  That's a fancy way of saying that
    the 'twisted' package doesn't want to include the 'twisted.conch'
    package, so it will pass ['conch'] as the value.

    should point to 'twisted'.  This ensures that your data_files are

    of the tuple ('twisted/conch/*').
