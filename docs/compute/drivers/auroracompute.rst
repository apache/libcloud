AuroraCompute Computer Driver Documentation
===========================================

`PCextreme B.V.`_ is a Dutch cloud provider. It provides a public cloud offering
under the name AuroraCompute. All cloud services are under the family name Aurora.

The datacenters / availability zones are located in:

- Amsterdam (NL)
- Rotterdam (NL)
- Miami (US)

The AuroraCompute driver is based on the CloudStack driver. Please refer to
:doc:`CloudStack Compute Driver Documentation <cloudstack>` page for more
information.


Instantiating a driver
----------------------

When you instantiate a driver you need to pass the following arguments to the
driver constructor:

* ``key`` - Your AuroraCompute API key
* ``secret`` - Your AuroraCompute secret key

You can find your 'key' and 'secret' in the AuroraCompute `Control Panel`_ under
your users.

With these credentials you can instantiate a driver:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/compute/auroracompute/instantiate_driver.py
   :language: python


Create a Virtual Machine (node)
-------------------------------

Creating a Virtual Machine on AuroraCompute using libcloud works the same as on any
other platform. This example is just to show exactly that.

This example will create a Virtual Machine in Amsterdam. Should you want to create
one in one of our other regions you should take a look at the example below which
shows how to use our different regions.

.. literalinclude:: /examples/compute/auroracompute/create_node.py
   :language: python


Using a different region
------------------------

By default the region AMS (Amsterdam) is selected by the driver.

AuroraCompute supports multiple regions and when instantiating the driver you can
choose a region.

Keep in mind that each region uses different credentials. These can be found in
the `Control Panel`_ under your users.

In this example we select the Miami (MIA) region:

.. literalinclude:: /examples/compute/auroracompute/instantiate_driver_region.py
   :language: python
