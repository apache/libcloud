Committer Guide
===============

New committer guidelines
------------------------

.. note::

    This section outlines steps which need to be completed by new team members and
    is indented for people who have been voted to join Libcloud project as a
    committer and / or PMC member. It also assumes you have already filled
    your ICLA and your Apache account has been created.

First congratulations and welcome to the team!

1. Subscribe to the public mailing lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven't yet, subscribe to {dev,users,notifications}@libcloud.apache.org
mailing lists. Notifications mailing list is especially important because all of
the JIRA notification, Github Pull Request notifications and build notifications
are sent there.

2. Subscribe to the private mailing list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subscribe to private@libcloud.apache.org by sending an email to
private-subscribe@libcloud.apache.org. Keep in mind that this list is private
and your subscription needs to be approved by a moderator.

3. Create PyPi account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a PyPi account by going to
https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form and send an email to
private@libcloud.apache.org requesting to be added as a maintainer to
`apache-libcloud <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/apache-libcloud/>`_ package.
Make sure to select a strong and unique password (``pwgen -s 48 1`` is your
friend).

After you have registered go to
"`Your details <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=user_form>`_" page and
populate `PGP Key ID` field with your PGP key ID.

Applying a patch
----------------

When applying a third-party patch created using ``git format-patch`` or
``git diff`` command, use the following command:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git am --signoff < patch_name.patch

``--signoff`` argument signs the patch and lets others know that you have
reviewed and merged a patch.

If you are working with a Github pull request, you can obtain a patch file
by appending ``.patch`` to the end of the pull request URL. For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    wget https://github.com/apache/libcloud/pull/<pr number>.patch
    git am --signoff < <pr number>.patch
    # rebase to squash commits / ammend
    ...

When working with a Github pull request, also don't forget to
update the commit message during rebase (or use ``git commit --amend`` if the
rebase was not necessary) to include the "Closes #prnumber" message. This way,
the corresponding Github pull request will get automatically closed once the
Github mirror is updated.

For example::

    ...
    Original message
    ...

    Closes #prnumber

If the original patch author didn't squash all of the commits into one and you
think this is needed, you should squash all the commits yourself using
``git rebase`` after you have merged / applied the patch.

After the patch has been applied, make sure to update ``CHANGES.rst`` file.

Making a release (for release managers)
---------------------------------------

This section contains information a release manager should follow when
preparing a release.

1. Pre-release check list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Make sure tests pass on all the supported Python versions (``tox``)
* Make sure ``CHANGES`` file is up to date
* Make sure ``__version__`` string in ``libcloud/__init__.py`` is up to date
* Remove the ``tox`` directory with ``rm -rf .tox``
* Remove the _secrets_ file with ``rm libcloud/test/secrets.py``
* Remove leftover builds from previous releases. ``rm -f dist/apache*``

2. Update JIRA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Create a new JIRA version for the release in question (if one doesn't exist
  yet)
* Close all the corresponding JIRA tickets and set ``Fix Version/s`` field
  to the current version
* Release the JIRA version

3. Creating release artifacts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a script that runs the required setup.py commands and then hashes
and signs the files. You will need the latest version of ``pip`` and the ``wheel``
package. To run it:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    cd dist
    ./release.sh -u <yourusername>@apache.org

``-u`` argument will be used to find a key with a matching email address in
your local GPG database.

This should result in a set of
``apache-libcloud-${VERSION}.{tar.bz2,tar.gz,zip,whl}{,asc,md5,sha1}`` files that
are suitable to be uploaded for a release.

Copy the artifacts in another directory, unpack one of them and test it with ``tox``.

4. Tagging a release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tag the tentative release with a ``-tentative`` postfix.

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git tag <version> <commit hash>

For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git tag --sign v0.15.0-tentative 105b9610835f99704996d861d613c5a9a8b3f8b1

5. Upload the release artifacts and start a [VOTE] thread
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upload all release artifacts including the ``whl`` files to your people.apache.org
space. Then start a [VOTE] thread on the dev@libcloud.apache.org mailing list.

Once the vote has passed tag the release with a new tag, removing the ``-tentative`` postfix.
Upload the release artifacts to Apache servers and Pypi.

For example:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git tag --sign v0.15.0 105b9610835f99704996d861d613c5a9a8b3f8b1

The commit SHA needs to be the one release artifacts are based on (aka the one
people voted on) and the same one you used for the ``-tentative`` tag.

Keep in mind that it's important that you sign the commit / tag with your GPG
key.

6. Uploading release artifacts to Apache servers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add release artifacts to the dist SVN repository at
  https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/libcloud/

  It may take up to a day for the artifacts to be available on all the
  Apache mirrors, but they should be instantly available at
  http://www.apache.org/dist/libcloud/.

* If there is more than one old release in the repository, delete rest of the
  old release and only leave current and previous release there. Old releases
  are automatically archived and available at
  https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/libcloud/.

7. Publishing package to PyPi
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have a script that runs uploads the signed Python source files to PyPi. It uses twine, so ensure
you have twine available in your path `which twine` before running. Twine can be downloaded from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twine

.. sourcecode:: bash

    cd dist
    ./deploy.sh

Once all the files have been uploaded, the page should look similar to the
screenshot below.

.. image:: _static/images/pypi_files_page.png
   :width: 700px
   :align: center

8. Verifying the release artifact check sums
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify that nothing went wrong doing the release process, run the
``./dist/verify_checksums.sh`` script.

This script downloads the release artifacts from the Apache and PyPi server and
makes sure that the MD5 check sums of the both files match.

Usage:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ./dist/verify_checksums.sh <version>

For example

.. sourcecode:: bash

    ./dist/verify_checksums.sh apache-libcloud-0.13.2

9. Updating doap_libcloud.rdf, __init__.py
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add information about the new release to the ``doap_libcloud.rdf`` file in the
root of the main code repository.

Update ``__version__`` attribute in ``libcloud/__init.py__`` file and indicate
we are now working on a new release by incrementing a number and adding ``dev``
suffix. For example, if version ``2.2.1`` has been released you would change
it from:

.. sourcecode:: python

    __version__ = '2.2.1'

To:

.. sourcecode:: python

    __version__ = '2.2.2dev'

10. Updating website
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Check out the website using SVN: ``svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/libcloud/site/trunk``

* Update the front page (``source/index.html`` file)
* Update "Downloads" page (``source/downloads.md`` file)
* Add a blog entry in the ``_posts`` directory.

Build the site locally and make sure everything is correct. Check the ``README.md`` file.

11. Sending announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Send a release announcement to {dev,users}@libcloud.apache.org. If it's a
  major release also send it to announce@apache.org.
* Send a release announcement to Twitter and Google+

Note: If the release fixes a security vulnerability, you should also send
information about a vulnerability to the following full disclosure mailing
lists:

* full-disclosure@lists.grok.org.uk
* bugtraq@securityfocus.com

The email you send should also be signed using your GPG key. You can find
an example of such announcement on the `following url <http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Jan/11>`_.

If needed, use Apache URL shortening service - http://s.apache.org/
